rest

""/test""
).get().type(ClassA.class).to(
""direct:someRoute""

rest
(
""/testSub""
).get().type(ClassB.class).to(
""direct:someOtherRoute""
);
And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.
Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:
/test:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: 
'#/definitions/ClassA'
However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme
 
/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
             type : 
'string'
             format : 
'com.ClassB'
However I'd expect it to be:
/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref:
